About

Architecture Used:

MVVM(Model-View-ViewModel) is the architecture pattern used in this project.

It provides Maintainability, testability, extensibility and, in general, a more clean and maintainable codebase.

Advantages of MVP

Maintainability:

A clean separation of different kinds of code should make it easier to go into one or several of those more granular and focused parts and make changes without worrying.

That means you can remain agile and keep moving out to new releases quickly.

Testability:

With MVVM each piece of code is more granular and if it is implemented right your external and internal dependences are in separate pieces of code from the parts with the core logic that you would like to test.

That makes it a lot easier to write unit tests against a core logic.


Extensibility :

It sometimes overlaps with maintainability, because of the clean separation boundaries and more granular pieces of code.

We have a better chance of making any of those parts more reusable.

It has also the ability to replace or add new pieces of code that do similar things into the right places in the architecture.

Library Used:

Coroutines,LiveData,Viewmodel,Retrofit,Gson etc
